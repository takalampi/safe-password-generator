# Safe password generator
Creates a safe but memorable password for different platforms.

Everyone knows that same passwords should not be used across different platforms - however, many still do. This is often because remembering multiple safe passwords (includes numbers, symbols, capital and lower case letters and isn't a dictionary word) for different platforms can be difficult.

This programme creates a safe password using an algorithm, meaning that the passwords don't necessarily need to be remembered.  Knowing the logic of the algorithm is enough. The user will need to choose a unique word of their liking which can be used in all passwords across different platforms.
